Running tests on the current display is not permitted.

Test suites can take over the keyboard, mouse, and display for long
periods. It is recommended that tests be executed in software-defined
nested display.

  See: https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man1/Xnest.1.html
  See: https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr/
  See: https://github.com/io7m-com/xoanon/issues/19

On X11 platforms, specifying an alternative existing display using
the DISPLAY environment variable can work:

  DISPLAY=:1

If you really want to run tests on this display, define the following
environment variable:

  XOANON_REALLY_USE_LOCAL_DISPLAY=true
